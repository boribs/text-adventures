# Text Adventures!

A very simple text adventures engine that I developed for school.

It reads files that follow this syntax:
```
#Title
#Author
#Version

<section id> #section text
[
    <section id> #option text
    <section id> #option text
]
<section id> #section text
[
    <section id> #option text
    <section id> #option text
]
```

The first four lines have to be that way, no newlines allowed at the beginning.
Check out the [examples](examples)!
